<h2>Memory regions</h2>
<p>
    As you know, the Game Boy's CPU has a 16-bit address space: it can access up to 65,536 bytes of memory at any time, labelled from $0000 to $FFFF. Now, although from the CPU all of these bytes are equal, the programmer needs to be aware that not all of these bytes are the same. Simple example: some of the memory is the ROM where the game code is, some of the memory is the RAM. We need to know where each is.

    Here are the different memory types; we will explain them one by one.
