    In this section, we'll learn about how the CPU operates, without going into complex details. This section should be accessible to everyone, and at the end of it, we will write a simple "Hello World!" program.

    Before starting, please ensure you have downloaded and installed an assembler and emulator on your computer. Refer to <a href="tools.html">the Tools section</a> for a list.

    During this tutorial, I will be using RGBDS and BGB on Linux; if you're using another combination and something doesn't work, please click the "Report issue" link in the navigation box, and decribe what part of the tutorial failed, and <strong>how</strong>. I need all of that info to be able to fix it.

    Unlike a lot of languages, writing a Hello World ROM for the Game Boy in ASM is a long process. Be sure to read through the entire section -- don't skip to writing the ROM. Taking notes may help.
