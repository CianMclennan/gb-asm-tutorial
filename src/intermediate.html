    In this section, we are going to dive deeper into the Game Boy. If you're comfortable with the previous section, this one should be easier. We're going to see the rest of the "basic" concepts, and we're going to start a <strong>bigger</strong> project. That's right, at the end of this section, we will have built a <s>clone</s> variation of Arkanoid!
