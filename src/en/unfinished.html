    Sorry! But I haven't had time to finish this tutorial. Don't worry, I still update it, though irregularly. In the meantime, here are some links you should follow:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://gbdev.gg8.se/wiki/articles/Pan_Docs">The GBDev Wiki's Pan Docs</a>. This is one of the many copies on the net, but this one's errors have been corrected, and it's kept up to date with recent research.</li>
    <li><a href="https://gbdev.github.io/">The Awesome GBDev List</a>. This is a community-curated list of resources deemed awesome. That should be self-explanatory. Oh, and there's also a Discord link near the top of it, if want to ask us more.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Finally, I'd like to warn you: the reason I started this tutorial is because all other tutorials out there, except Duo's ASMSchool (at the time I'm writing, anyways), are filled with bad practice. I would recommend avoiding picking up habits from their code, even if it seems like the norm.
