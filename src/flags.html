    In this section, we will see new instructions at the same time as the flags, to help understand how instructions work with flags.

<h2>The <code>f</code> register</h2>
<p>
    <code>f</code> being an 8-bit register, it has 8 bits. Bits 0-3 are always zero. Bits 4-7 are called <code>C</code>, <code>H</code>, <code>N</code>, and <code>Z</code>, in that order. Note that, to avoid confusing register <code>c</code> and flag <code>c</code>, flags sometimes get an "<code>f</code>" appended to them (eg. <code>CF</code>, <code>ZF</code>).

    As always, each of these letters stands for something:
</p>
<dl>
    <dt>c</dt><dd>Carry</dd>
    <dt>h</dt><dd>Half-carry</dd>
    <dt>n</dt><dd>Add/Subtract (ok, this one doesn't make sense)</dd>
    <dt>z</dt><dd>Zero</dd>
</dl>
