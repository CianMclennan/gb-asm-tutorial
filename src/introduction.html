<h2>A word of warning</h2>
<p>
    <strong>If you have never programmed before, I don't recommend starting with ASM.</strong>
    <br />
    ASM is a very unique kind of language, so starting with it makes it much more difficult to grasp. You can give it a go anyways, but this tutorial is primarily intended for people who have some programming experience. If you're OK with learning another language before ASM, I recommend C.
    <br />
    If you only ever did object-oriented programming, ASM may take you by surprise quite a bit. ASM is the CPU's language, and CPUs are fundamentally imperative - thus, ASM is an imperative language. I think there exist some C++ solutions for the Game Boy, but given how difficult it is to make a game run smoothly using ASM (let alone C), I <b>strongly</b> don't recommend using C++ on the Game Boy. And it's not a mixed opinion like with C.
